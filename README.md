Week 1
### Flows in Networks
Network flows are crucial for transporting goods or data across networks with limited capacity, like highways or the internet. This unit covers the mathematical foundations and key algorithms of network flows, along with surprising examples of unrelated problems solvable by these concepts.

Week 2
### Linear Programming

Linear programming optimizes a linear function subject to linear inequalities, applicable to diverse problems like flow optimization and cost-effective dieting. This unit explores the significance of linear programming and tools for solving these problems efficiently.

Week 3
### NP-complete Problems

Week 4
### Coping with NP-completeness

Week 5
### Streaming Algorithms (Optional)
